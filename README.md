# Getting Started
## Create a database
Database creation is simple, assuming you already have a Roo account.  To create your database, simply open your Terminal window and type `roo db add <database name>`.  For example:
```
roo db add artists-database
```
If you don't presently have Roo installed, contact Trip Ottinger at tripott@awesomesauce.com to request an account.
